# SAT-SED: Semi-supervised Sound Event Detection by Pseudo-Labeling with Self-Adaptive Threshold Strategy

## Introduction
We propose self-adaptive threshold SED (**SAT-SED**).
- The SAT strategy adjusts the threshold in a self-adaptive manner during training based on the learning status of each class.
- The SAT strategy is composed of self-adaptive clip- (**SACT**) and frame-wise threshold (**SAFT**) strategies. As the SAT strategy is exclusively employed during the training phase, it improves the system’s performance without increasing the model’s parameters and inference time.
